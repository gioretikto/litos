# litos (v. 1.2 Experimental version)

litos is a simple text editor for the [Xfce](https://www.xfce.org) desktop environment.

**litos** aims to be an easy-to-use and fast editor. My target is an
editor for quickly editing text files, providing shortcuts for inserting HTML tags. I try to use the latest
GTK features available, which means that if GTK adds something new in a major
release that is useful for the editor, we will likely bump the GTK dependency
and integrate this new feature in **litos**.

### Required Packages 

Mousepad depends on the following packages:

* [GTK](https://www.gtk.org) >=3.20.0
